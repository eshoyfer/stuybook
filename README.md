## Info

Submitted as a project for the Spring '13 Intro to CS class at Stuyvesant HS during my sophomore year.

The goal: to create an old-school dynamic from scratch, avoiding the use of any front-end or back-end frameworks.

The front-end is hand-coded HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and the back-end is in Python using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).

The project hosted here is currently in its original form from 2013 without any modifications. The following issues exist:

* The HTML/CSS overlaps on lower resolutions
* Lack of a proper organized directory structure
* Proper documentation should be written
